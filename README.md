# Sylvia_Wang_Resume
Hi! 

This is my updated resume! 

My old resume lowkey sucks so I switched to a new layout and tried building it in HTML and CSS since I love the designs a lot. 

Had a lot of fun today building it up! Can't wait to learn more about other exciting technologies out there!

Feel free to check it out at https://sylvia830.github.io/Sylvia_Wang_Resume/

It is still a work in process :D 

(as a matter of fact, I'm going to update it tomorrow morning or afternoon or maybe evening. Anyway, good night!)
